I am Jacky and welcome to my blog, this is the space where I will record some of mine personal study experiences, reflect on my learning processes and track my thinking pathways (i.e. how my thoughts/views on different things progress overtime). I am currently a first year uni student who learns a little of mathematics and computer science, but also loves solving problems and figuring out how things work. In most cases, my blog will be about my the new things I have learnt, my opinions on these new knowledge and how they’ve inspired upon my vision of sight. But I will also include some personal life blogs or share some of my notes. I will try to update my blog once or twice a week so please follow up! </p>
<p>Anyway, this is my blog. Welcome!</p>
<p>I have just completed the first semester of my university studies at Melbourne. We are at a lockdown now and all classes during the past school days were online. So my first semester after high school were very challenging and somehow, unique. But it was still very rewarding though! During the last three months, I studies four subjects: Linear algebra, Calculus 2, Physics 1 and Foundations of computing(Python), which I’ve greatly enjoyed and it was really different from the what I learnt in high school. I’ve found significant connections between these four subjects and physics, mathematics and computing did not feel like isolated subjects as they have been during my primary and secondary education. But rather, for me they seem like branches of a great set of knowledge – something I yet need to discover. But for me, problem solving were the most common factor between these subjects and is what I love the most about them. Whether in mathematics in computing, we all need to use the knowledge we learnt, format them in a logical, succinct way and eventually, solve some type of problem which is useful in real life. In high school, I felt like the purpose of my study is only to achieve the highest marks and get a good feedback on these parent teacher interviews – but at uni, things were different. The knowledge I learnt actually appeared to have a purpose and are closely related to our everyday lives! The goal of learning have swifted to contribute something to the society or solve the problems you face in real life, which is what I greatly appreciate and want to do more about.</p>
<p>I think I will stop here for today – there are still updates I need to make about my personal blog website and please look forward to it! During the next couple days I will write on the details of my studies and where I actually get these inspirations from. Please keep on track!</p>
<p>(Special thanks to my little helper that normally does nothing to help me @lesleymin)</p>
